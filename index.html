                 who has partnered with a luxury real estate marketing company.</h3>
            <h4 class="text1" >One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their ability to market 
                your property to the right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience
                 will be able to identify who will be interested in your property and implement effective
                  strategies to reach them via their website, paid advertising, social media, and other means. 
                  When you work with an agent who has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit from the 
                  many different types of marketing capabilities the company offers. Here is how:

                            estate agent has to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality
                             content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the
                              agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. 
                              According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work 
                              with an agent who uses video—and for good reason. An agent who uses video is 
                              able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. 
                              When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would 
                              really be like to walk through and live in your home—something that is much more 
                              difficult to do with a written description.
                            However, written descriptions—or copywriting—is also important. Your property needs to be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

                            <h4 class="texteffective" >Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home 
                                they purchased on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms that 
                                they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your home to show 
                                up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right
                                terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred 
                                to as search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly 
                                using the right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury 
                                Presence have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your 
                                home, your property will show up in the results and provide opportunities 
                                for the buyer to learn more.
